The speed of execution of two implementations of the Maxmin algorithm is compared for the selection of maximally diverse subsets of large compound collections. Different versions of the software are compared using various C compiler options and Java virtual machines. The analysis shows that the Maxmin algorithm can be implemented in both languages yielding sufficient speed of execution. For large compound libraries the Java version outperformes the C version. While the Java version selects the same compounds independent of the virtual machine used, the C version produces slightly different subsets depending on the compiler and on the optimization settings.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an established method for parameter optimization. It represents a population-based adaptive optimization technique that is influenced by several "strategy parameters". Choosing reasonable parameter values for the PSO is crucial for its convergence behavior, and depends on the optimization task. We present a method for parameter meta-optimization based on PSO and its application to neural network training. The concept of the Optimized Particle Swarm Optimization (OPSO) is to optimize the free parameters of the PSO by having swarms within a swarm. We assessed the performance of the OPSO method on a set of five artificial fitness functions and compared it to the performance of two popular PSO implementations. 
RESULTS:Our results indicate that PSO performance can be improved if meta-optimized parameter sets are applied. In addition, we could improve optimization speed and quality on the other PSO methods in the majority of our experiments. We applied the OPSO method to neural network training with the aim to build a quantitative model for predicting blood-brain barrier permeation of small organic molecules. On average, training time decreased by a factor of four and two in comparison to the other PSO methods, respectively. By applying the OPSO method, a prediction model showing good correlation with training-, test- and validation data was obtained.

CONCLUSION:Optimizing the free parameters of the PSO method can result in performance gain. The OPSO approach yields parameter combinations improving overall optimization performance. Its conceptual simplicity makes implementing the method a straightforward task.}},

Thus, the neural circuits in their olfactory system are likely to implement an efficient method for coding, processing, and classifying chemical information. Here, we describe a computational method to process molecular representations and classify molecules. The three-step approach mimics neurocomputational principles observed in olfactory systems. In the first step, the original stimulus space is sampled by “virtual receptors,” which are chemotopically arranged by a self-organizing map. In the second step, the signals from the virtual receptors are decorrelated via correlation-based lateral inhibition. Finally, in the third step, olfactory scent perception is modeled by a machine learning classifier. We found that signal decorrelation during the second stage significantly increases the accuracy of odorant classification. Moreover, our results suggest that the proposed signal transform is capable of dimensionality reduction and is more robust against overdetermined representations than principal component scores.

Their main purpose is to translate chemical space into information that can be processed by neural circuits. Assuming that these receptors have evolved to cope with this task, the analysis of their coding strategy promises to yield valuable insight in how to encode chemical information in an efficient way. 
RESULTS:We mimicked olfactory coding by modeling responses of primary olfactory neurons to small molecules using a large set of physicochemical molecular descriptors and artificial neural networks. We then tested these models by recording in vivo receptor neuron responses to a new set of odorants and successfully predicted the responses of five out of seven receptor neurons. Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.66 to 0.85, demonstrating the applicability of our approach for the analysis of olfactory receptor activation data. The molecular descriptors that are best-suited for response prediction vary for different receptor neurons, implying that each receptor neuron detects a different aspect of chemical space. Finally, we demonstrate that receptor responses themselves can be used as descriptors in a predictive model of neuron activation.

CONCLUSION:The chemical meaning of molecular descriptors helps understand structure-response relationships for olfactory receptors and their "receptive fields". Moreover, it is possible to predict receptor neuron activation from chemical structure using machine-learning techniques, although this is still complicated by a lack of training data.}},

abstract = {{The honeybee Apis mellifera has a remarkable ability to detect and locate food sources during foraging, and to associate odor cues with food rewards. In the honeybee’s olfactory system, sensory input is first processed in the antennal lobe (AL) network. Uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs) convey the sensory code from the AL to higher brain regions via two parallel but anatomically distinct pathways, the lateral and the medial antenno-cerebral tract (l- and m-ACT). Neurons innervating either tract show characteristic differences in odor selectivity, concentration dependence, and representation of mixtures. It is still unknown how this differential stimulus representation is achieved within the AL network. In this contribution, we use a computational network model to demonstrate that the experimentally observed features of odor coding in PNs can be reproduced by varying lateral inhibition and gain control in an otherwise unchanged AL network. We show that odor coding in the l-ACT supports detection and accurate identification of weak odor traces at the expense of concentration sensitivity, while odor coding in the m-ACT provides the basis for the computation and following of concentration gradients but provides weaker discrimination power. Both coding strategies are mutually exclusive, which creates a tradeoff between detection accuracy and sensitivity. The development of two parallel systems may thus reflect an evolutionary solution to this problem that enables honeybees to achieve both tasks during bee foraging in their natural environment, and which could inspire the development of artificial chemosensory devices for odor-guided navigation in robots.}},

This yields a combined task-independent estimate of perceived difference between odor pairs. Comparing these perceived differences to published measures of physicochemical difference reveals a weak correlation. A notable exception are 3-octanol and benzaldehyde, which are distinct in published accounts of chemical similarity and in terms of their published sensory representation but nevertheless are consistently regarded as the most similar of the 10 odor pairs employed.

We test how strongly flies avoid a binary mixture after punishment training with one of its constituent elements and how much, in turn, flies avoid an odor element if it had been a component of a previously punished binary mixture. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that we first adjust odors for task-relevant behavioral potency, that is, for equal learnability. Doing so, we find that 1) generalization between mixture and elements is symmetrical and partial, 2) elements are equally similar to all mixtures containing it and that 3) mixtures are equally similar to both their constituent elements. As boundary conditions for the applicability of these rules, we note that first, although variations in learnability are small and remain below statistical cut-off, these variations nevertheless correlate with the elements’ perceptual “weight” in the mixture; thus, even small differences in learnability between the elements have the potential to feign mixture asymmetries. Second, the more distant the elements of a mixture are to each other in terms of their physicochemical properties, the more distant the flies regard the elements from the mixture. Thus, titrating for task-relevant behavioral potency and taking into account physicochemical relatedness of odors reveals rules of mixture perception that, maybe surprisingly, appear to be fairly simple.}},

Physicochemical descriptors that encode features of the molecular graph are a popular choice for such an encoding. Here, we explore the EVA descriptor set, which encodes features derived from the vibrational spectrum of a molecule. We assessed the performance of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) to predict the gradual response of Drosophila ORs. We compared a 27-dimensional variant of the EVA descriptor against a set of 1467 descriptors provided by the eDragon software package, and against a 32-dimensional subset thereof that has been proposed as the basis for an odor metric consisting of 32 descriptors (HADDAD). The best prediction performance was reproducibly achieved using SVR on the highest-dimensional feature set. The low-dimensional EVA and HADDAD feature sets predicted odor-OR interactions with similar accuracy. Adding charge and polarizability information to the EVA descriptor did not improve the results but rather decreased predictive power. Post-hoc in vivo measurements confirmed these results. Our findings indicate that EVA provides a meaningful low-dimensional representation of odor space, although EVA hardly outperformed “classical” descriptor sets.}},

abstract = {{ Segmentation of functional parts in image series of functional activity is a common problem in neuroscience. Here we apply regularized non-negative matrix factorization (rNMF) to extract glomeruli in intrinsic optical signal (IOS) images of the olfactory bulb. Regularization allows us to incorporate prior knowledge about the spatio-temporal characteristics of glomerular signals. We demonstrate how to identify suitable regularization parameters on a surrogate dataset. With appropriate regularization segmentation by rNMF is more resilient to noise and requires fewer observations than conventional spatial independent component analysis (sICA). We validate our approach in experimental data using anatomical outlines of glomeruli obtained by 2-photon imaging of resting synapto-pHluorin fluorescence. Taken together, we show that rNMF provides a straightforward method for problem tailored source separation that enables reliable automatic segmentation of functional neural images, with particular benefit in situations with low signal-to-noise ratio as in IOS imaging.}},

abstract = {{Computational neuroscience has uncovered a number of computational principles used by nervous systems. At the same time, neuromorphic hardware has matured to a state where fast silicon implementations of complex neural networks have become feasible. En route to future technical applications of neuromorphic computing the current challenge lies in the identification and implementation of functional brain algorithms. Taking inspiration from the olfactory system of insects, we constructed a spiking neural network for the classification of multivariate data, a common problem in signal and data analysis. In this model, real-valued multivariate data are converted into spike trains using “virtual receptors” (VRs). Their output is processed by lateral inhibition and drives a winner-take-all circuit that supports supervised learning. VRs are conveniently implemented in software, whereas the lateral inhibition and classification stages run on accelerated neuromorphic hardware. When trained and tested on real-world datasets, we find that the classification performance is on par with a naïve Bayes classifier. An analysis of the network dynamics shows that stable decisions in output neuron populations are reached within less than 100 ms of biological time, matching the time-to-decision reported for the insect nervous system. Through leveraging a population code, the network tolerates the variability of neuronal transfer functions and trial-to-trial variation that is inevitably present on the hardware system. Our work provides a proof of principle for the successful implementation of a functional spiking neural network on a configurable neuromorphic hardware system that can readily be applied to real-world computing problems.}},

We characterized an olfactory-processing pathway, comprised of inhibitory projection neurons (iPNs) that target the LH exclusively, at morphological, functional and behavioral levels. We demonstrate that iPNs are subdivided into two morphological groups encoding positive hedonic valence or intensity information and conveying these features into separate domains in the LH. Silencing iPNs severely diminished flies' attraction behavior. Moreover, functional imaging disclosed a LH region tuned to repulsive odors comprised exclusively of third-order neurons.

However, nociceptor morphology has been hard to access and the mechanisms of signal transduction remain unresolved. In order to understand how heat transducers in nociceptors are activated in vivo, it is important to estimate the temperatures that directly activate the skin-embedded nociceptor membrane. Hence, the nociceptor's temperature threshold must be estimated, which in turn will depend on the depth at which transduction happens in the skin. Since the temperature at the receptor cannot be accessed experimentally, such an estimation can currently only be achieved through modeling. However, the current state-of-the-art model to estimate temperature at the receptor suffers from the fact that it cannot account for the natural stochastic variability of neuronal responses. We improve this model using a probabilistic approach which accounts for uncertainties and potential noise in system. Using a data set of 24 C-fibers recorded in vitro, we show that, even without detailed knowledge of the bio-thermal properties of the system, the probabilistic model that we propose here is capable of providing estimates of threshold and depth in cases where the classical method fails.}},

abstract = {{ Estimating the distance of a gas source is important in many applications of chemical sensing, like e.g. environmental monitoring, or chemically-guided robot navigation. If an estimation of the gas concentration at the source is available, source proximity can be estimated from the time-averaged gas concentration at the sensing site. However, in turbulent environments, where fast concentration fluctuations dominate, comparably long measurements are required to obtain a reliable estimate. A lesser known feature that can be exploited for distance estimation in a turbulent environment lies in the relationship between source proximity and the temporal variance of the local gas concentration − the farther the source, the more intermittent are gas encounters. However, exploiting this feature requires measurement of changes in gas concentration on a comparably fast time scale, that have up to now only been achieved using photo-ionisation detectors. Here, we demonstrate that by appropriate signal processing, off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors are capable of extracting rapidly fluctuating features of gas plumes that strongly correlate with source distance. We show that with a straightforward analysis method it is possible to decode events of large, consistent changes in the measured signal, so-called ‘bouts’. The frequency of these bouts predicts the distance of a gas source in wind-tunnel experiments with good accuracy. In addition, we found that the variance of bout counts indicates cross-wind offset to the centreline of the gas plume. Our results offer an alternative approach to estimating gas source proximity that is largely independent of gas concentration, using off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors. The analysis method we employ demands very few computational resources and is suitable for low-power microcontrollers.}},

Exploring potential bio-inspired improvements, we note a number of neuronal network models have demonstrated some success in classifying static datasets by abstracting the insect olfactory system. However, these designs remain largely unproven in practical settings, where sensor data is real-time, continuous, potentially noisy, lacks a precise onset signal and accurate classification requires the inclusion of temporal aspects into the feature set. This investigation therefore seeks to inform and develop the potential and suitability of biomimetic classifiers for use with typical real-world sensor data. Taking a generic classifier design inspired by the inhibition and competition in the insect antennal lobe, we apply it to identifying 20 individual chemical odours from the timeseries of responses of metal oxide sensors. We show that four out of twelve available sensors and the first 30 s (10\%) of the sensors' continuous response are sufficient to deliver 92\% accurate classification without access to an odour onset signal. In contrast to previous approaches, once training is complete, sensor signals can be fed continuously into the classifier without requiring discretization. We conclude that for continuous data there may be a conceptual advantage in using spiking networks, in particular where time is an essential component of computation. Classification was achieved in real time using a GPU-accelerated spiking neural network simulator developed in our group.}},

We propose an active search approach for robots equipped with MOX gas sensors and an anemometer, given an occupancy map. Events of rapid change in the MOX sensor signal (“bouts”) are used to estimate the distance to a gas source. The wind direction guides a Gaussian regression, which interpolates distance estimates. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we extend previous work on gas source distance estimation with MOX sensors and propose a modification to cope better with turbulent conditions. Second, we introduce a novel active search gas source localization algorithm and validate it in a real-world environment.}},

Here we develop a spiking neural network model for neuromorphic hardware that uses spike timing-dependent plasticity and lateral inhibition to perform unsupervised clustering. With this model, time-invariant, rate-coded datasets can be mapped into a feature space with a specified resolution, i.e., number of clusters, using exclusively neuromorphic hardware. We developed and tested implementations on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic system and on GPUs using the GeNN framework. We show that our neuromorphic clustering algorithm achieves results comparable to those of conventional clustering algorithms such as self-organizing maps, neural gas or k-means clustering. We then combine it with a previously reported supervised neuromorphic classifier network to demonstrate its practical use as a neuromorphic preprocessing module.}},

We undertook a large-scale approach at characterising molecular receptive ranges (MRRs) of glomeruli in the dorsal olfactory bulb (dOB) innervated by the MOR18-2 olfactory receptor, also known as Olfr78, with human ortholog OR51E2. Guided by an iterative approach that combined biological screening and machine learning, we selected 214 odorants to characterise the response of MOR18-2 and its neighbouring glomeruli. We found that a combination of conventional physico-chemical and vibrational molecular descriptors performed best in predicting glomerular responses using nonlinear Support-Vector Regression. We also discovered several previously unknown odorants activating MOR18-2 glomeruli, and obtained detailed MRRs of MOR18-2 glomeruli and their neighbours. Our results confirm earlier findings that demonstrated tunotopy, that is, glomeruli with similar tuning curves tend to be located in spatial proximity in the dOB. In addition, our results indicate chemotopy, that is, a preference for glomeruli with similar physico-chemical MRR descriptions being located in spatial proximity. Together, these findings suggest the existence of a partial chemical map underlying glomerular arrangement in the dOB. Our methodology that combines machine learning and physiological measurements lights the way towards future high-throughput studies to deorphanise and characterise structure-activity relationships in olfaction.}},

Beyond power efficiency, sparse codes have favourable properties for associative learning, as they can store more information than local codes but are easier to read out than dense codes. Auto-encoders with a sparse constraint can learn sparse codes, and so can single-layer networks that combine recurrent inhibition with unsupervised Hebbian learning. But the latter usually require fast homeostatic plasticity, which could lead to catastrophic forgetting in embodied agents that learn continuously. Here we set out to explore whether plasticity at recurrent inhibitory synapses could take up that role instead, regulating both the population sparseness and the firing rates of individual neurons. We put the idea to the test in a network that employs compartmentalised inputs to solve the task: rate-based dendritic compartments integrate the feedforward input, while spiking integrate-and-fire somas compete through recurrent inhibition. A somato-dendritic learning rule allows somatic inhibition to modulate nonlinear Hebbian learning in the dendrites. Trained on MNIST digits and natural images, the network discovers independent components that form a sparse encoding of the input and support linear decoding. These findings confirm that intrinsic homeostatic plasticity is not strictly required for regulating sparseness: inhibitory synaptic plasticity can have the same effect. Our work illustrates the usefulness of compartmentalised inputs, and makes the case for moving beyond point neuron models in artificial spiking neural networks.}},

Here, we report the development, implementation and initial results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change ±100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7 ± 28.7, mean ± SD), taste (-69.0 ± 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3 ± 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and chemesthesis.

abstract = {{In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the focus is often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system contains a large number of cells that are insensitive to spatial contrast and, instead, respond to uniform homogeneous illumination of their visual field. The purpose of this information remains unclear. Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature homogeneity in visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time coincidence, in a purely feed-forward and therefore rapid manner. We demonstrate how homogeneity information can interact with information on contrast edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism’s performance. We show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be partly mitigated through delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes bi-phasic post-synaptic events. The delay of the feed-forward inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of the temporal integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely feed-forward architecture that supports low-latency processing, making it an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks where rapid responses and low spike counts are desired.}},

abstract = {{A café, the metro, a supermarket, a book store - many locations of everyday life have a specific smell. Recognising such olfactory scenes could inform personal activity tracking, environmental monitoring, and assist robotic navigation. Yet it is unclear if current Metal-oxide (MOx) sensor technology is sensitive and specific enough to achieve this. Factors like sensor drift, and sensitivity to ambient humidity and temperature further complicate the recognition of olfactory scenes. Hotplate temperature modulation has been suggested as a method to counter these drawbacks. We present an electronic nose based on MEMS-MOx sensors that support rapid hotplate temperature modulation with a 150 ms period. We recorded different natural olfactory scenes in an urban context. A linear SVM was able to recognise four olfactory scenes in single hotplate cycles with near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same day, and 73\% accuracy when tested in the same locations on the next day. Gas sensor responses yielded higher recognition accuracy than humidity, temperature, and pressure, which were also partly-location specific. Our results indicate that hotplate modulation enables recognition of natural odor scenes across extended timespans. These findings encourage the use of MOx-sensors as rapid sensing devices in natural, uncontrolled environments.}},

We sought to better characterize this relationship in the mouse olfactory system by defining glomeruli in terms of the odorants to which they are most sensitive. Using high-throughput odorant delivery and ultrasensitive imaging of sensory inputs, we imaged responses to 185 odorants presented at concentrations determined to activate only one or a few glomeruli across the dorsal olfactory bulb. The resulting datasets defined the tuning properties of glomeruli - and, by inference, their cognate odorant receptors - in a low-concentration regime, and yielded consensus maps of glomerular sensitivity across a wide range of chemical space. Glomeruli were extremely narrowly tuned, with \textbackslashtextasciitilde25\% responding to only one odorant, and extremely sensitive, responding to their effective odorants at sub-picomolar to nanomolar concentrations. Such narrow tuning in this concentration regime allowed for reliable functional identification of many glomeruli based on a single diagnostic odorant. At the same time, the response spectra of glomeruli responding to multiple odorants was best predicted by straightforward odorant structural features, and glomeruli sensitive to distinct odorants with common structural features were spatially clustered. These results define an underlying structure to the primary representation of sensory space by the mouse olfactory system.}},

However, navigation algorithms that are driven by odour encounter events, can successfully find odour sources by extracting spatiotemporal information. The event driven nature of odour plumes motivates a fully event-driven sensing and processing pipeline for robot navigation. Hence, we developed a spiking neural network, implemented on neuromorphic hardware, that can successfully decode odour-puff direction from a pair of enose-systems. This is to our knowledge the first fully event driven neuromorphic system for odour localization.}},

Out of different types of gas sensors, metal oxide (MOx) sensors are extensively used in such applications because of their portability, low cost, and high sensitivity for specific gases. However, how to effectively sample the MOx data for the real-time detection of gas and its concentration level remains an open question. Here, we introduce a simple analog front end for one MOx sensor that encodes the gas concentration in the time difference between pulses of two separate pathways. This front-end design is inspired by the spiking output of a mammalian olfactory bulb. We show that for a gas pulse injected in a constant airflow, the time difference between pulses decreases with increasing gas concentration, similar to the spike time difference between the two principal output neurons in the olfactory bulb. The circuit design is further extended to an MOx sensor array, and this sensor array front end was tested in the same environment for gas identification and concentration estimation. Encoding of gas stimulus features in analog spikes at the sensor level itself may result in data and power-efficient real-time gas sensing systems in the future, which can ultimately be used in uncontrolled and turbulent environments for longer periods without data explosion.}},

While these advancements are prominent in vision and auditory perception, their potential in machine olfaction remains under-explored, particularly in the context of fast sensing. Here, we outline the perspectives for neuromorphic principles in machine olfaction. Considering the physical characteristics of turbulent odour environments, we argue that event-driven signal processing is optimally suited to the inherent properties of olfactory signals. We highlight the lack of bandwidth limitation due to turbulent dispersal processes, the characteristic temporal and chemical sparsity, as well as the high information density of the odour landscape. Further, we critically review and discuss the literature on neuromorphic olfaction; particularly focusing on neuromorphic principles such as event generation algorithms, information encoding mechanisms, event processing schemes (spiking neural networks), and learning. We discuss that the application of neuromorphic principles may significantly enhance response time and task performance in robotic olfaction, enabling autonomous systems to perform complex tasks in turbulent environments—such as environmental monitoring, odour guided search and rescue operations, and hazard detection.}},

We discover a data feature that is representative of the presented odor stimulus at a certain concentration—irrespective of temporal variations caused by the plume dynamics. Further, we design a neuromorphic electronic nose front-end circuit for extracting and encoding this feature into analog spikes for gas detection and concentration estimation. The design is loosely inspired by the spiking output of parallel neural pathways in the mammalian olfactory bulb. We test the circuit for gas recognition and concentration estimation in artificial environments, where either single gas pulses or pre-recorded odor plumes were deployed in a constant flow of air. For both environments, our results indicate that the gas concentration is encoded in—and inversely proportional to—the time difference of analog spikes emerging out of two parallel pathways.

Understanding their function is crucial for deciphering olfactory perception and exploring emerging roles in non-olfactory systems. With the recent surge in available sequence data and AI-based structural predictions, computational modelling has become indispensable for investigating OR structure, ligand binding, and activation mechanisms. This review provides a comprehensive overview of computational approaches used in OR research, including homology modelling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, and machine learning-based predictions. Both ligand-based and structure-based pharmacophore modelling are discussed in detail, highlighting their respective applications, strengths, and limitations. While structure-based approaches have gained prominence due to advances in receptor structure prediction tools like AlphaFold, ligand-based pharmacophore modelling remains valuable in scenarios where structural data are limited or uncertain. Case studies illustrate how these techniques have been applied to identify novel OR-ligand interactions, explore receptor dynamics, and support drug discovery. Collectively, these computational strategies offer powerful tools for decoding OR function, guiding experimental validation, and expanding our understanding of olfactory signalling in health and disease.}},
